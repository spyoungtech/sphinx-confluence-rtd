# sphinx-confluence-rtd
Stylesheet to apply RTD styling to confluence sites/spaces
Includes relevant CSS from the rtd theme with tweaks to apply style to confluence pages. Tested against Confluence 6.2.2 but should work in other versions.

Intended for use with [sphinx-confluence](https://github.com/Arello-Mobile/sphinx-confluence)

Simply copy the contents of the css file into your custom site or space CSS. (**(space/global)settings -> look and feel -> stylesheet**)
